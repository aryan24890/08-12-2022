	<h1>How EMAIL WORKS</h1>
	<pre>
	
	You compose and send an email from your email client. The email client connects to the Outgoing
	SMTP server and handovers the email in MIME format. The Outgoing SMTP validates the sender details
	and processes the message for sending and places it in Outgoing queue.
